Anyone with any level of Python knowledge is a candidate for a great talk. As there is attendees of all kinds, we need speakers of all kinds.

So if you could give a talk (or a few), then please share those subjects with us, this will help us to organize future Meetup events.

Feel free to give your talk in your preferred language: English, Catalan or Spanish.
