List of tasks to organize a Python Meetup
-----------------------------------------

1. Import new suggested talks from [Submit Spreadsheet][3] to [Speaker list spreadsheet][4]

2. Check the venues availability: Coordinate with Loris if Meetup is held at PRBB or Maria if held at Itnig.

3. Decide a date for the Meetup and open a new event on [Meetup.com][2]

4. Check if we got 3 new speakers in the [Speaker list spreadsheet][4]. (feel free to organize lightnighting talks too but try to make the meetup event 2h max)

    4.1. If #4 is False, send a mail to request for new Speakers (see [mail template][1])

    * if #4.1 is not successful, contact previous speakers. if still no one is available, the organizer should give a talk :)

    4.2. If #4 is True, decide/select the talks and then contact the speakers to ensure they are available for Meetup date.

5. Update [Meetup page][2] and [Pybcn Website][6] with Speakers program.

6. Give guidance to the new speakers, about talks duration, venue, etc...

7. On the day of the Meetup:
      - Ensure the venue is open (get keys)
      - Present the talks, make a call for speakers to recruit for the next meetups
      - Tweet about the talk / take pictures

8. Post-Meetup: Thanks the speakers and request them to upload their slides.

9. Update [Website archive section][7] with the talks slides and add links twitted pictures.

10. Enjoy a well deserved beer!
