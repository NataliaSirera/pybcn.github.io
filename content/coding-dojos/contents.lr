body:

For those who haven't attended one, a dojo is a practical session in which we work on a exercise, called kata, on groups, with different approaches, with the main goal of have fun, share knowledge with and learn from others.

The pyBCN group has been organizing monthly dojos for the last year, with different setups and themes.
