short_bio: I'm a passionate Software Architect that loves to learn and that enjoys being out of the comfort zone, being faced with a great challenge and having to overcome it to achieve the goal!  That's why I've been CTO in Belgium, I've created and streaming platform for an Australian company, I've worked as a senior frontend developer for a New Zealand company, I've done trainings for an Argentinian company and I've advised one of the biggest companies in Singapore. I'm good at what I do because I love what I do, and you can see it in how I work.
