Hey! I'm Pavel, but, please, call me just Pasha. I relocated just 2 years ago to Barcelona. I'm using python already for 10 years and really love the flexibility of this language. But if you'll ask me what are my most loved programming languages, Python won't be in my top 2. I can explain you why so after several beers in the bar. Now I'm working as a Team Leader, but I never stop writing code and practicing Python. See you on PyDay BCN 2022!
