Staff software engineer at Veriff. Has been coding professionally since 2005 and is currently building all sorts of cool platform software to support automated identity verification.

Fell in love with software development after playing Bang! Bang!, Ski Free, Minesweeper, Sokoban and Pipe Dream for too much time. Never really created any games herself, but still thinks that coding is really fun!

She also thinks that writing about herself in third person is really strange ðŸ¤”
