Adrià is a last year BSc student in Physics at UB. Before joining Qilimanjaro’s QaaS team as a junior software engineer, he carried out two internships. First, he collaborated with Dr. Miquel Montero to develop teaching material for Master Students related to Quant Finance. Then, he worked as a Trainee Data Analyst for Schneider Electric, where he was introduced to AWS services. His professional interests span across Data Science, Quantitative Finance and Quantum Computing. In fact, in his BSc Final Thesis he is exploring how quantum annealing will help to solve very complex financial problems, such as portfolio optimization. He would define himself as proactive, intense and fast-learner. Always eager to learn and broaden his horizons.
