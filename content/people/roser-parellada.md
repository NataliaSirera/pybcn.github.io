I graduated in Chemistry in 2017, and now I'm finishing my master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. I've worked in different places and with people from around the world. 

My programming knowledge comes from what I learned by myself (C programming), and during the master's degree (R and Python). 

Passionate about sports, cats, gardening, board games and, of course, coding.
