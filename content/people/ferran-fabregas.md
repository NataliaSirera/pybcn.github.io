short_bio: "Computer scientist and programmer by profession, I started in the “maker” world 7 years ago, in which I have developed a cross-disciplinary knowledge in different disciplines of digital manufacturing, electronics, robotics, micro-controller programming and education, trying to turn my passion into a full-time job.

Within this time I have published the book “How to use Raspberry Pi 4 through 100 practical exercises“ from Marcombo publisher and I’m working on another book about electronics for Makers. I have also been responsible for the technical correction of the Spanish translation of some tech-related books of the O’Reilly and Willey publishers.

I have presented different personal projects at fairs in London, Avignon and Brussels MakersTown, also at some Maker Faires held in Spain (Madrid, León, Bilbao and Barcelona), Maker Faire European Edition Rome’19, and at the MIT MediaLab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in addition to publishing articles in magazines such as MagPi and the book “The official Raspberry Pi projects book”."
