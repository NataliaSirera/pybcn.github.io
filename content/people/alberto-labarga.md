With a background in Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics, for the last fifteen years I have been involved in biomedical data science projects and systems administration, both at University and research centers, and as professional activity at several start-ups company which I contributed to create.

Currently I lead the Health Data Unit at Barcelona Supercomputing Center, where we develop tools and best practices for secure health data management and analysis within and open science environment: FAIR data, federated learning, virtual research environments, etc. We also are applying artificial intelligence and natural language processing to electronic health records. We process thousands of clinical records daily, applying latest technologies to extract information from texts, images or genomes, in a cloud neutral containerized environment using Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, docker, Kubernetes, Airflow, etc.
