Guillermo studied Physics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) where he did his Bachelor’s Thesis about Skyrmions in the superconducting group, where after graduating, he kept researching them and collaborating as an Associate Professor of Computer Modelling. Meanwhile, he also did an MSc in Theoretical Physics at the University of Barcelona (UB), where he did his Master’s Thesis about QED in 1+1dim. He then continued his career into the industry, working at Glovo for 7 months, where he made up his mind about entering the quantum computation world, joining Qilimanjaro’s Software Team, where he is using and growing his knowledge in quantum physics and computer science with the development of software to control our quantum hardware.
