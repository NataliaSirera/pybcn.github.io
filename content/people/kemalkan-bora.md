Hi, I'm Kemalcan,

I have 7 years of developer experience in backend development. Generally, I code with Python but for the last 3 years, I've been working on Go and AWS. Mostly I prefer open-source technology and contribute to some open-source technology such as AutoML, V-lang, etc.

I graduated with MIS at the University of Bart覺n and after that, I completed my master's degree at the University of Y覺ld覺r覺m Beyazit nowadays I am doing a Ph.D. at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and my field of research is NLP.
