I’m a husband, father, physicist, and data scientist. In that order.
<br>Husband: I met my soulmate when we were 13, we started dating when we were 18, and we got married when we were 24.
<br>Father: we became parents in 2020, and then again in 2022. And it’s the best thing that has ever happened to us.
<br>Physicist: I studied a degree and a master in physics. I even published a paper in Nature.
<br>Data Scientist: after studying physics I realized that academia wasn’t for me. For the past seven years, I’ve been learning, building, and breaking things related to data. Now, I work as a Data Scientist at Wallapop where I build machine learning systems to help you find the best items.
