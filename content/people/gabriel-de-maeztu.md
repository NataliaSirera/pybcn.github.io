short_bio: Medical doctor and mathematician, during my work as a researcher, I found out that I could fuse the two passions of mine, provide health care and pattern recognition. Today I work at the intersection of medicine and machine learning. That means that I use numbers to understand patients and diseases better. I work with large amounts of data to build tools that help us to contextualize all the information and make better decisions. I believe that the cross-section between medicine and data-driven technologies will define the medicine of the future.
