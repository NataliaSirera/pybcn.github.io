short_bio: "Started coding at the age of 13, and it's still one of my most enjoyable activities. I've used a number of languages over the decades, but I tend to gravitate towards Python.


I enjoy the world of Continuous Delivery, and often made myself a Developer Enabler: helping building the capabilities, platforms, tools and processes to make team members better and faster at delivering quality software-powered solutions to users."
