I did my masters in Bioinformatics at UPF, and now I am doing my PhD in Bioinformatics in UB. I am good at python and I like group works, and workshops a lot. I usually learn better when I am practicing and I believe these workshops are very useful in this sense. So, I would love to participate and share! I love horror movies, and am an amateur aerial hoop learner!
