Oriol discovered his passion for computational statistics and open source during his MSc in Astrophysics and has been working the topic since then. He started contributing to ArviZ and PyMC (two Python libraries related to Bayesian modeling) in 2019, joining their core teams not long after that. He started working in academia but he left after some years in order to be able to work more freely and collaboratively on open source, software and knowledge sharing. His main areas of interest are data visualization, model and inference diagnostics, model comparison, and prior elicitation. Within open source projects, he has also dedicated a large part of his work to documentation, governance and DEI. He currently works as a consultant with PyMC Labs, as an instructor on Intuitive Bayes and as open source maintainer for PyMC and ArviZ.
