I am a computational statistician with a passion for open source, teaching and community building. I am currently working as open source maintainer of ArviZ and PyMC, both Python libraries related to Bayesian modeling and sponsored by NumFOCUS. I try to ensure that my open source work targets all areas of the projects and is not code-centric. Among other things for example, I do extensive documentation work and led ArviZ's and PyMC's participation in Google Season of Docs. I am also an instructor at IntuitiveBayes and I have taught undergrad courses on maths and statistics as external lecturer.
