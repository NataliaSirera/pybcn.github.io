PyLadiesBCN organizes a meetup each month, usually a **guided hands-on workshop**. Our events are hosted at one of our [sponsors](/pyladies_bcn/sponsors) nice spaces, followed by networking and socializing time (a.k.a. pizza&beers). Each sessions is coordinated by one of our fantastic [organizers](/pyladies_bcn/organizers-and-speakers), and usually counts with some speakers and volunteers. 

Would you like to **propose a workshop or a talk**? [Fill the form!](/pyladies_bcn/call-for-proposals)
