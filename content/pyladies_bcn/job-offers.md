Is your company offering jobs or scholarships? Share your offers with us and we'll forward it to the subscribers of the PyLadiesBCN mailing list.
Alternatively, you can also post them to the [general PyBCN community](/pybcn_association/job-offers).

To **check** past job offers, go to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-bcn/messages/archive/" target="_blank">Mailing List Archive</a>.

To **publish** a new job offer:

* Send it to pyladies-bcn+jobs at googlegroups.com.
* Subject: *Job offer: {POSITION} at {COMPANY}*, where *{POSITION}* is the position of the job offer, and *{COMPANY}* is the name of your company.
* For the body, feel free to check other job offers as inspiration.
* If the rules are met, we'll publish the offer!

All job offers **must** follow these rules:

1. Be related to Python.
2. Contain a good job description.
3. Provide the name of the company, and direct company contact info.
4. Provide a salary range.

To get more visibility of what you do, consider [organizing a workshop](/pyladies_bcn/call-for-proposals/) or offering to host the meetup!

**Disclaimer**: We ban cheaters. Don't post offers in comments, events, or discussions!
