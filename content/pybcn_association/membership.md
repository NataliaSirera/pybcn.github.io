The Python Barcelona Association, a.k.a. PyBCN, is a non-profit organisation with more than 10 years of history, focused on increasing the usage and knowledge of the Python programming language. By becoming a member, you'll support the association's activities and programs, helping us to increase the number of activities, to improve them (i.e. getting a better recording system for the meetups) and to cover basic expenses (domains, meetup fees...). **For just 20€/year you can now become a member of our community!**
