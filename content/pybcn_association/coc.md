PyBCN is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in
any form. This does not only extend to members to local PyBCN communities,
but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger PyBCN community of
users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal
characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online
spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic
meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or
unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or
bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the
community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning
the offender, expulsion from any PyBCN event, or expulsion from mailing
lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications
channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from PyBCN Meetup
group membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of
the PyBCN community, IRC chat admins, website admins, or
organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of
PyBCN.
