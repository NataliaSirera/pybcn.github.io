All job offers are sent to the subscribers of the mailing list.

To **check** past job offers, go to the [Mailing List Archive](https://www.meetup.com/python-barcelona/messages/archive/).

To **publish** a new job offer:

* Send it to pybcn+jobs at googlegroups.com.
* Subject: *Job offer: {POSITION} at {COMPANY}*, where *{POSITION}* is the position of the job offer, and *{COMPANY}* is the name of your company.
* For the body, feel free to check other job offers as inspiration.
* If the rules are met, we'll publish the offer!

All job offers **must** follow these rules:

1. Be related to Python.
2. Contain a good job description.
3. Provide the name of the company, and direct company contact info.
4. Provide a salary range.

As your email will be sent to the Meetup.com's mailing list, it's important to notice it removes all mail addresses and attachments, so, please avoid these.

To get more visibility of what you do, consider [giving a talk](/pybcn_association/propose-a-talk/) or offering to host the meetup!

**Disclaimer**: We ban cheaters. Don't post offers in comments, events, or discussions!
