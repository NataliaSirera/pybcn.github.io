We are excited to announce that we are organizing the third edition of PyDay in Barcelona!

PyDay Barcelona 2019 is going to take place on *October 19th in Universitat de Barcelona*, a full day full of FREE python-related activities for the Python community. Over the last two editions, PyDay has become a great opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies and newcomers into it!

We count with an incredible group of volunteers and contributing entities but we still need your help to make this event not only possible but awesome! For information about the past editions, please visit [PyDay 2016](https://pybcn.org/pyday-bcn-2016/) (you can also see some photos) and [PyDay 2018](https://pybcn.org/pyday-bcn-2018/) web pages.

# What is PyDay Barcelona 2019 about?
## Hands-on workshops
We are planning to have different thematic tracks --i.e. data science, web development, security, beginners-- with hands-on guided workshops of about 2 hours in which participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques.

## Django Girls workshop
This year we are planning to host a parallel DjangoGirls workshop! 

A Django Girls event is a one-day workshop with an installation party the evening before or remotely via Google Hangout/Skype. During the whole day participants work in small groups (3 attendees + 1 coach) and go through the tutorial to successfully create a blog application and deploy it to the internet.

Django Girls events are always non-profit and free for participants. We do not pay coaches, speakers or organizers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming and there is no age limitation. All the attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity.

[Registration is now open for Django Girls Barcelona](https://djangogirls.org/barcelona/)

## Other activities
Hackathons, quizzes, contests, lightning talksâ€¦ We want PyDay BCN 2019 to be as enlightening and fun as possible!
