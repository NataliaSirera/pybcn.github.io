## About PyDay BCN 2023

We are organizing the **the seventh edition** of PyDay in Barcelona!

PyDay is an event full of FREE **python-related workshops** and activities for the Python community, organized once per year. Over the <a href="#previous_editions_section">last six editions</a>, PyDay has become a great opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies and newcomers into it!

#### When and where

It is scheduled for **Saturday 11th November** in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RT9THKhxqz3eTvxf7" target="_blank">Universitat de Barcelona</a>, from 9:00am to 18:00pm CET, aprox.

#### A full day of in-person hands-on workshops

PyDay BCN 2023 will have different **thematic tracks** --e.g. data science, web development, security-- with hands-on workshops of about 90 minutes in which participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques, fully guided by members of the community and support volunteers.

#### Participate in Kahoot and win prizes!

We will host a Kahoot game with questions about PyBCN and Python in general, with prizes for the fastest players. Will you miss it?!
