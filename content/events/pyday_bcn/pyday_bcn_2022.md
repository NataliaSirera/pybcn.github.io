Unfortunately, there are not many tutorials available yet and the documentation is limited. So we will be happy to share with you how to: 1) Break down AWS infrastructure into reusable constructs represented by Python classes; 2) Combine own and public constructs into Stack applications; 3) Deploy CDK apps to AWS cloud"

## About PyDay BCN 2022 

We are organizing the **the sixth edition** of PyDay in Barcelona!  

PyDay is an event full of FREE **python-related workshops** and activities for the Python community, organized once per year. Over the <a href="#previous_editions_section">last five editions</a>, PyDay has become a great opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies and newcomers into it!


#### When and where
It is scheduled for **Saturday 26th November** in <a href="https://g.page/Canodrom?share" target="_blank">Canòdrom - Ateneu d'Innovació Digital i Democràtica</a>, from  9:30pm to 19:00pm CET, aprox.



#### A full day of in-person hands-on workshops
PyDay BCN 2022 will have different **thematic tracks** --e.g. data science, web development, security-- with hands-on workshops of about 90 minutes in which participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques, fully guided by members of the community and support volunteers.


#### Participate in Kahoot and win prizes!
 We will host a Kahoot game with questions about PyBCN and Python in general, with prizes for the fastest players. Will you miss it?!
