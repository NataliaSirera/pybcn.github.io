## What is PyDay BCN 2020 about?

We are excited to announce that we are organizing **the fourth edition** of PyDay in Barcelona! This year it will be an **online event** with up to 200 attendees. It is scheduled for **12th of December from 4pm to 8pm CET**.

PyDay is an event full of FREE python-related activities for the Python community, organized once per year. Over the last three editions, PyDay has become a great opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies and newcomers into it!

### Talks, demos and lightning talks
We are planning to have different **thematic tracks** --e.g. data science, web development, security-- with talks and demos of about 20 minutes in which participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques, and also shorter lightning talks. The videos will be **pre-recorded and released on YouTube** along the event according to the agenda, and we will host live **Q&A sessions through Slack**.

### Participate in Kahoot and win prizes!
 We will host a Kahoot game with questions about PyBCN and Python in general, with prizes for the fastest players. Will you miss it?!
 

<br/>Please notice that <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">the Schedule is provisional</span> and will be updated soon.
