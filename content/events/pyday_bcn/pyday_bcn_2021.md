## About PyDay BCN 2021 

We are organizing the **the fifth edition** of PyDay in Barcelona!  

PyDay is an event full of FREE **python-related workshops** and activities for the Python community, organized once per year. Over the <a href="#previous_editions_section">last four editions</a>, PyDay has become a great opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies and newcomers into it!


#### When and where
It is scheduled for **Saturday 27th November** in <a href="https://g.page/Canodrom?share" target="_blank">Canòdrom - Ateneu d'Innovació Digital i Democràtica</a>, from  9:30pm to 19:00pm CET, aprox.



#### A full day of in-person hands-on workshops
PyDay BCN 2021 will have different **thematic tracks** --e.g. data science, web development, security-- with hands-on workshops of about 90 minutes in which participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques, fully guided by members of the community and support volunteers.


#### Participate in Kahoot and win prizes!
 We will host a Kahoot game with questions about PyBCN and Python in general, with prizes for the fastest players. Will you miss it?!


#### Covid-safe event
We are super excited to be back to in person events, and we are working hard to make PyDay 2021 a safe encounter:
- We will ask all in-person attendees to show a vaccination certificate or have a negative covid test taken in the 24 hours previous to the event.
- We will have a reduced attendance ratio.
- Lunch will take place outside, and we will provide individual meals to each attendee.
- Sanitizer gel will be available in every room.
