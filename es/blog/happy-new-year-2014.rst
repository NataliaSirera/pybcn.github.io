We want 2014 to be a great year for our Python Meetup and the
organizers will try to set a monthly meetup to take place on the 3rd
Thursday of every month, the events will be announced via the meetup
group as always and also via our website PyBCN (http://pybcn.org/).

Our first meetup of the year will be on the 16th of January and the
topic will be "Python & Robotics".We are looking for extra speakers on
this topic, so if you know about robotics, arduino, etc... please get
in touch via our mailing-list barcelona-python@googlegroups.com or
simply reply to this message.

We will need speakers to prepare a 15-20 min presentation, but
lightning talks or other contributions are welcome. I

There is a google group: barcelona-python@googlegroups.com which we
will use to organize and discuss upcoming events, you are welcome to
join up and get in touch with us.

See you soon!
